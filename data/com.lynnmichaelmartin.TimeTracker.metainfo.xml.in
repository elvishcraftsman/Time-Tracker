	  <p>A simple time-tracker program for GNOME. Time Tracker allows you to track different projects, see how much time you've spent on each project, and sync with a local file or a file in your own cloud storage (if you have multiple computers). You can also open your sync file in spreadsheet software (since it's a CSV file).</p>
