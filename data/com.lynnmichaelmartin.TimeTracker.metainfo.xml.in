    <p>A simple time-tracker program for GNOME. Instead of using online-first options like Toggl and Clockify, use a lightning-fast local-first option that is still able to sync with multiple computers via cloud or network storage.</p>
    <p>Time Tracker allows you to track different projects, see how much time you've spent on each project, and sync with a local file or a file in your own cloud storage. You can also open your sync file in spreadsheet software (since it's a CSV file).</p>
    <p>Tracking:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Track the amount of time spent on different projects.</li>
    <li>Save the timer so that when Time Tracker is closed and reopened, it will continue tracking the same project, including the time while Time Tracker was closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Syncing:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sync with a local file somewhere in your home directory or just in the app's own system directory.</li>
    <li>Or sync with a file in your cloud storage (if mounted in home directory).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reporting:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>See how much time you've spent on each project today, this week, and last week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Backups:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Automatically save daily backups and keep a user-specified number of past backups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Preferences:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Set preferred first day of week for reporting purposes.</li>
    <li>Set how frequently Time Tracker autosaves.</li>
    <li>Set how many daily backups you want Time Tracker to keep.</li>
    <li>Set whether to use 24-hour format or 12-hour (AM/PM) format.</li>
    </ul>
