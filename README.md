# time-tracker

A simple time-tracker program for GNOME. Time Tracker allows you to
- Track different projects
- See how much time you've spent on each project today, this week, and last week
- Sync with a local file or a file in your own cloud storage
- Open your sync file in spreadsheet software (since it's a CSV file)
In future, Time Tracker may be able to create more detailed reports. Currently, that can be done by opening your sync file in LibreOffice Calc or another spreadsheet program.
